### About Me: 
Hi! My name is Monisha and I am a first year MURP concentrating in Transportation Policy and Planning. I've spent my entire life in Boston, where I grew up; attended Northeastern University; and then spent the last five years working at the MBTA, which is the public transit agency that serves the region. In my free time I enjoy running, hiking, and anything else that lets me be outside.
### About the Course: 
This course is intended to give students an introduction to programming with Python and to evaluating, analyzing, and visualizing spatial data. As an urban planning course, this work will focus on applications to urban policy and planning. 
### Project Ideas:
- Mapping the relationship between transportation infrastructure and gentrification/displacement
- Mapping inequities in public transit availabilty and service quality (e.g. frequency, reliability) based on neighborhoods demographics
- Mapping factors that increase crash risk and actual traffic collision data to understand inequities in traffic safety 
### Course Objectives:
I come to this course with basic GIS skills. My goals are to gain basic Python skills, improve my spatial analysis skills, and make some interesting maps!
